This is a plain text file for testing the text lexer.
It contains no special syntax, just regular text.

This is another paragraph with some numbers (123) and symbols (!@#$%^&*).

URLs like https://example.com and paths like C:\Users\test are also plain text.

Email: test@example.com

The text lexer should just display everything in the default style.
